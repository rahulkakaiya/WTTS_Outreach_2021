        \item In this activity you will be finding the distance to the Pearl Star Cluster, containing the C1 Pinnea Cepheid variable star.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item By using Henrietta Swan Leavitt's \emph{\textcolor{orange}{period-luminosity relationship}}, you will find the distance to the nearby Cepheid variable star and therefore the distance to the star cluster that it is in.
            \item You will be introduced to the computer programming language \emph{\textcolor{orange}{'Python'}} and will use a piece of code as a tool to interpolate the period-luminosity graph for the C1 Pinnea Cepheid variable star.
            \item In order to measure the distance to a new star cluster we must find the absolute magnitude, \textbf{\textcolor{red}{\(M\)}}, of the Cepheid variable star inside of the cluster.\\

            \begin{enumerate}
                
                \item Using the your calculator and the distance modulus relationship equation, calculate and complete the missing data of Cepheid variable stars in the Galaxy in table 1.
                
                \item Open the website: \href{https://repl.it/languages/python3}{\texttt{https://repl.it/languages/python3}}. Copy and paste the code from the file '\texttt{distance-determination.py}' to the left hand side of the website interface. 
                
                \item This code will create a period-luminosity relationship for the Cepheid variable stars in table 1. From the table, which variable would be on which axis for this graph? Once you've decided, label each axis in the code: (\texttt{\textcolor{green}{plt.xlabel('}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{x-label}}\textcolor{green}{')}}) (\texttt{\textcolor{green}{plt.ylabel(}'\textbf{\textcolor{red}{y-label}}\textcolor{green}{')}}). Check with your teacher before moving on to the next step.
                
                \item Using the data you have calculated in table 1, input the \(x\) and \(y\) axis data for the period-luminosity graph into the computer code. These values will be inputted here in the code: \texttt{\textcolor{green}{x = np.array([}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{data-point-1,data-point-2,etc}}\textcolor{green}{])}} for the \(x\) values, \texttt{\textcolor{green}{y = np.array([}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{data-point-1,data-point-2,etc}}\textcolor{green}{])}} for the \(y\) values. 
                
                \item Click \texttt{\textcolor{cyan}{run}} and allow the code to execute. A new image called \texttt{\textcolor{cyan}{cepheid.png}} will be created and display in the bottom right. Can you clearly see Henrietta Swan Leavitt's period-luminosity relationship? The gradient and y-intercept of this relationship is displayed in the top right. What is the equation of the line?
                
                \item Figure 1 shows the light diagram for C1 Pinnea Cepheid observed in the Pearl cluster. Estimate the oscillation period by reading x-axis minima/maxima periodicity.
                
                \item Using the period of C1 Pinnea and the equation of the line of the period-luminosity relationship, calculate C1 Pinnea's absolute magnitude, \textbf{\textcolor{green}{\(M\)}}. The average apparent magnitude, \textbf{\textcolor{green}{\(m\)}}, of C1 Pinnea is 15.26.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item By comparing observed HR data with stellar isochrones formed from simulated HR-diagrams for a population of stars, you will approximate the age of the Pearl star cluster.

            \item You will want to include an introduction, two or three main sections of researched and compiled information, and a conclusion highlighting the Physical significance of what you've researched.
            \item You should aim to write approximately a third about the red-giant branch and aim to directly answer the questions below, and two thirds on your related topic of choice.
